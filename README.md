WebappDeploymentBundle
======================

This bundle is created to provide a web interface to control basic deployment features of webapp bundles, using PleskRemoteControlBundle. 

The goal is to be able to add multiple servers and put them in a category (for instance: dev, testing, acceptance, production) and deploy a webapp straigt from a git repository with the necessary actions (database creation/update/..., user creation, vhost creation, ...)
